# Clinical Trial Analysis (Excel Project)

## Overview
The dataset comes from an imaginary randomized clinical trial comparing the results of two interventions (coded under the variable GROUP)

This repo consist of the following documents. By reviewing the key finding and dataset if you have any feedback or inputs to make it comperhensive pleaes let me know. 

1.	Group 1 received an intervention that is established in the field and its effectiveness is supported by evidence from past clinical trials. 
2. 	Group 2 received a new intervention for which little research has been done. 
3.	The 100 imaginary participants were all war survivors but some of them had been tortured in addition to their war experiences (coded under the variable TORTURE). 
4.	Researchers also recorded the GENDER and AGE of participants. 
5.	The impact of the interventions was measured in terms of symptoms of psychological distress (low scores are healthier than high scores). 
6.	The psychological assessment was conducted at intake and three months after the end of treatment.
    
## Research Questions
1.	Is respondents’ age related to their psychological symptoms at intake?
2.	Is respondents’ torture history related to their psychological symptoms at intake?
3.	Did the symptoms of group 2 participants improve, on average? How would you characterize the size and significance of this group’s symptom changes?
4.	Is there a difference in the effectiveness of interventions 1 and 2? If so, how would you characterize the difference? 

## Dataset Summary
- Two groups:  
  - **Group 1**: Received an established intervention  
  - **Group 2**: Received a limited-research intervention  
- Key demographic variables: Gender, age, torture history, psychological symptoms at intake and follow-up

## Methodology

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned data for missing values and inconsistencies
- Coded categorical variables and standardized psychological scores

### Analysis Techniques
- **T-tests** for comparing group means  
- **Correlation analysis** for relationships between variables  
- **Visualizations**: Scatter plots, bar charts, and box plots  
## Key Findings 
- Refer to the powerpoint slides for final analysis and my interpertation

## Limitations
- Small sample size
- Sampling bias
- Missing data on some psychological or socio-environmental variables
- Short follow-up period
- Limited generalizability due to intervention variability

## Analytics tool
- Excel for data entry and cleaning
- Excel for statistical testing and plotting
- Powerpoint (Key Finding Presnetation)
